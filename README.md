## Issues

I had already used my free trial for Google Cloud Platform, so I had to use my girlfriend' account. This lead to a synchronization issue between the google account logged into my browser and the google account on Google Cloud.

I ran into issues getting dionaea up and running from the second vm because I didn't have acces to Ctrl-V in that particular terminal. So I typed the command in wrong a few times which caused errors. Then I had to wipe the directory and try again.

## Summary

Within 5 minutes of putting the Dionaea honeyput up I recorded over 5000 attacks. I was able to see some of mine as well.
